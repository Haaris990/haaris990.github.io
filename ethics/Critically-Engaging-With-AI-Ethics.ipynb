    "In this lab we will be critically engaging with existing datasets that have been used to address ethics in AI. In particular, we will explore the [**Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/julian3833/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge). This challenge brought to light bias in the data that sparked the [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will dig into the dataset ourselves to explore the biases. We will further explore other datasets to expand our thinking about bias and fairness in AI in relation to aspects such as demography and equal opportunity as well as performance and group unawareness of the model. We will learn more about that in the tutorial below.\n",

    "- To ensure you have all the necessary Python libraries/packages for running code you are recommended to use your environment set up on the **Glasgow Anywhere Student Desktop**.\n",

    "- You can set up Anaconda on your own computer with the necessary libraries/packages. Please check how to set up a new environement in Anaconda and review the minimum list of Python libraries/packages, all discussed in Week 4 lab.\n",
    "- We strongly recommend that you save your notebooks in the folder you made in Week 1 exercise, which should have been created in the University of Glasgow One Drive - **do not confuse this with personal and other organisational One Drives**. Saving a copy of your notebooks on the University One Drive ensures that it is backed up (the first principles of digital preservation and information mnagement).\n",

Another type of bias could be interaction bias where AI is influenced by user interactions. \n",

Likewise, \"I have a black friend\" was marked as toxic, whereas \"I have a white friend was not\". The algorithm appears to mistakenly identify several identities as toxic, although none of these remarks should be flagged as toxic. This is an indication of bias: the model appears to be biassed against Muslims and in favour of Christians, as well as against Black people. Comments associated with Islam being flagged as toxic can also show historical bias.\n",

    "# Task 5: AI and Explainability\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will explore the reasons behind decisions that AI makes. While this is really hard to know, there are some approaches developed to know which features in your data (e.g. median_income in the housing dataset we used before) played a more important role than others in determining how your machine learning model performs. One of the many approaches for assessing feature importance is **permutation importance**.\n",

    "Permutation importance can be a useful measure of feature importance in certain contexts. If the model's performance significantly drops after shuffling a specific feature, it suggests that the feature is important. However it may not capture interactions between features.
